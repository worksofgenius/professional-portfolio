- name: Pantry
  description: Developed in less than four weeks, Pantry is a unique mobile web app that empowers households to reduce food waste. It was the headlining project launched at the largest Demo Day for Le Wagon Tokyo, on March 12, 2021. Simply scan the barcode of a food item to save its name, amount, and expiration date. If you’re struggling to remember expiration dates, receive reminders and search for recipes that use those ingredients. Save your favorite recipes to use again. Create shopping lists in Pantry and send it to your household’s group chat in LINE to facilitate communication about shopping needs. After shopping, add all purchased food items to Pantry directly from LINE by typing, “Pantry shopping done!” The app will be available for select users in the future.
